This project is a monitoring system for freezers in a shed that is uninhabited most of the time. A recent coolroom failure resulted 
in over a thousand dollars of spoiled food. 
The previous LoRa solution has been discarded as LOS transmission path not available. Will use WhatsApp messaging and shed wifi.

A master unit will read temperature on a number of DS18B20 temp sensors that will be placed in the freezers at the shed, display the 
temps on an LCD and using the shed wifi send 12 hourly whatsapp messages detailing current temps to me and alarm messages if temps 
exceed zero or the rate of temp change increases indicating a failure.
There are two freezers and a coolroom, two sensors may be hardwired to the local freezers and the coolroom sensor may be disconnected 
when not in use. If the coolroom is required the sensor can be reconnected and the monitor power cycled to pickup the extra sensor.
